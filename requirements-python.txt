# needed for managing databases (e.g. creating project db in infra step)
# mysql
# We are using a fork of PyMySQL that has SSL enabled by default
# Ansible ansible_util does not allow setting ssl parameter without setting ca_cert at the same time
# This could be workarounded by using config_file parameter but this only works when implementation
# uses real mysql client and not PyMySQL
# PyMySQL implementation also loads the config file but it does not support setting ssl parameter
# while it makes inpossible to enable ssl without providing certificate, implementation supports such scenario
# in later code. This is why we are using forked version of PyMySQL that enables ssl by default
# when it's not explicitly disabled. This should be always safe, because if ssl is not enabled on server
# implementation will fallback to non-ssl connection.

# distro 1.7.0 breaks fact discovery in ansible for some nodes
# distro introduced breaking change that changed package
# from using single file to directory module, this isn't compatible with
