# Whether to enable cronjob that remounts EFS
# Note: Normally this is not needed, but this was a workaround
# for problems with S3FS mounts. Some EFS mounts were overlayed over
# directories mounted with S3FS. When S3FS was broken the EFS mount
# would be broken too. Amazon-efs-utils already have buil-in watch dog
# but it didn't seem to handle this scenario.
