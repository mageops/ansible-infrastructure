# Additional logging configuration

# If enabled then will log cacheable html page response which were a varnish cache miss.
# This translates to the following conditions regarding the upstream response:
#   - header `Content-Type` starts with `text/html`
#   - header `Cache-Control` starts with `public`
#   - header `X-Magento-Cache-Debug` equals `MISS`
#   - reponse code is 200 OK

# An array of items each containing:
# - name - used internally for naming files
# - server_name - primary hostname; wildcard character will
#   skip creation of the `server_name` directive catching all hosts;
#   it cannot be wildcard if letsencrypt is enabled, it will be used for cert
#   generation
# - aliases - (optional) list of additional server names, also used for cert generation;
#   a single letsencrypt cert will be generated for each host, aliases will be added to
#   the SAN section
# - cert_path - (optional) local path to the certificate; if set this
#   file will be installed on server in the appropriate location
# - cert_key_path - (optional) local path to the certificate's private key;
#   if set this file will be installed on server in the appropriate location
# - letsencrypt - (optional, default: false) - if true then certs will be
#   generated using letsencrypt

# Warning! If you don't set cert_path or cert_key_path you have to provide

#
# Warning! The private key should be encrypted with ansible vault if stored
