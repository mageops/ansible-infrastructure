# Additional logging configuration

# If enabled then will log cacheable html page response which were a varnish cache miss.
# This translates to the following conditions regarding the upstream response:
#   - header `Content-Type` starts with `text/html`
#   - header `Cache-Control` starts with `public`
#   - header `X-Magento-Cache-Debug` equals `MISS`
#   - reponse code is 200 OK

# An array of items each containing:
# - name - used internally for naming files
# - server_name - primary hostname; wildcard character will
#   skip creation of the `server_name` directive catching all hosts;
#   it cannot be wildcard if letsencrypt is enabled, it will be used for cert
#   generation
# - aliases - (optional) list of additional server names, also used for cert generation;
#   a single letsencrypt cert will be generated for each host, aliases will be added to
#   the SAN section
# - cert_path - (optional) local path to the certificate; if set this
#   file will be installed on server in the appropriate location
# - cert_key_path - (optional) local path to the certificate's private key;
#   if set this file will be installed on server in the appropriate location
# - letsencrypt - (optional, default: false) - if true then certs will be
#   generated using letsencrypt
# - extra_config - custom config block to add to the vhost file above
#   the auto-generated main `server` block
# - extra_vhost_config - custom config block to add inside the
#   the auto-generated main `server` directive
# - redirect_aliases - (default: no) - whether the aliases should be redirected
#   with 301 to the main `server_name`
# - permanent_path_redirect_map - a map of request patterns to redirect using 301
