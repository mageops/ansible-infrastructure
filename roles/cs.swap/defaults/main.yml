# how kernel will use swap, example values:
# * 0 - swap only to prevent out of memory
# * 1 - minimum amount of swapping
# * 10 - some swapping, may improve performance even if enough memory
# * 60 - system default (we don't want that)
# * 100 - aggressive swapping (don't want that for sure, especially on EBS)

# PERFORMANCE+STABILITY TODO Whether to enable zswap compression
# - Not implemented yet, needs (tested manually):
#   0) Make sure zswap is supported by kernel and we're not running in docker
#      * This shall return `=y` for both: `cat "/boot/config-$(uname -r)"  | grep -ie 'CONFIG_ZSWAP\|CONFIG_HAVE_KERNEL_LZO'`
#   1) Add "zswap.enabled=1 zswap.max_pool_percent=25 zswap.compressor=lzo zswap.zpool=zbud"
#      to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in `/etc/default/grub`
#   2) Rebuild grub cfg: `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`
#   3) Reboot system
#   4) Wait for SSH to ssh come back up
# - Ideally we'd use compressor=lz4 compressor and zpool=z3fold but they are 
#   not present in CentOS 7 stock kernel.

# swap_enable_compression: no
