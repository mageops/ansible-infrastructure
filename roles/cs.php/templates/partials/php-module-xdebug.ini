; BEGIN ------------------------- BEGIN
;
; Since we want to enable XDebug conditionally / only for special
; PHP-FPM pool we need to have a separate php.ini file for this
; use case.
;
; Zend modules cannot be loaded dynamically in pool configuration
; so a separated config is a must.
;
; IMPORTANT!
; Make sure that /etc/php.d/15-xdebug.ini does not override any of these 
; settings or this approach will not work. 
;
; NOTE: Especially we need to make sure that /etc/php.d/15-xdebug.ini does
; not load xdebug module as we DO NOT want it loaded for normal website
; operation. It's enabled automatically upon package installation so be wary.
;
; ALSO NOTE: XDebug must be loaded and configured AFTER opcache at all times!
;
; The reason for all of this is that php config includes ALWAYS override php.ini
