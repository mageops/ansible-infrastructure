# For more targets check QUALITY_SSIM in pio-worker source code, but you might provide here arbitrary value in 0.0 - 1.0 range
# but keep in mind that values above 0.1 are propably too crappy for anything
# Real quality used might be different as we will try to seek for quality that will
# have SSIM score closest to this value
pio_media_target_ssim: 0.000548 # this is 99 quality
# This quality will be used when performing fast and dirty temporary optimization
