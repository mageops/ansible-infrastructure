# For more targets check QUALITY_SSIM in pio-worker source code, but you might provide here arbitrary value in 0.0 - 1.0 range
# but keep in mind that values above 0.1 are propably too crappy for anything
# Recommended value is below 0.001 - as lower tend to generate visible artifacts on low contrast images
# Real quality used might be different as we will try to seek for quality that will
# have SSIM score closest to this value
